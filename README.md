# 🌍 Awesome Geospatial Embeddings 

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) 
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](../../pulls)

A curated list of papers that **define, analyze, or evaluate geospatial embeddings** —  
how spatial, temporal, or semantic Earth data are represented in embedding space,  
and how those embeddings behave or are applied.

> This list intentionally excludes generic pretraining or downstream models where embeddings are incidental.
